      <h1>AIR & WATER QUALITY INDEX</h1>
      <p>
       <strong>Air Quality index</strong><br/><br/>

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a numerical scale used to communicate the quality of the air in a specific location at a given time. It provides information about how clean or polluted the air is and what potential health effects might be associated with breathing that air. AQI values typically range from 0 to 500, with lower values indicating better air quality and higher values indicating poorer air quality.<br/><br/><br/>

<strong>Water Quality index</strong></b><br/><br/>

The Water Quality Index (WQI) is a numerical rating or classification that is used to describe the quality of water in a specific area at a particular time. Similar to the Air Quality Index (AQI) for air quality, the WQI provides a standardized way to communicate the overall condition of water based on various physical, chemical, and biological parameters.<br/><br/><br/>

<strong>Factors determine the Air Quality Index (AQI) of a particular area</strong></b><br/><br/>

The Air Quality Index (AQI) of a particular area is determined by several factors, primarily the concentration levels of various air pollutants. The specific pollutants considered in calculating the AQI typically include:<br/><br/>

Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10): These are tiny particles suspended in the air, which can originate from various sources such as vehicle emissions, industrial processes, construction activities, and natural sources like dust and wildfires.<br/>

Ground-Level Ozone (O3): Ozone is formed in the atmosphere through chemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. High concentrations of ozone are often associated with urban areas and can be exacerbated by emissions from vehicles and industrial sources.<br/>

Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2): NO2 is a gas primarily emitted from combustion processes, such as vehicle engines, power plants, and industrial facilities. It can contribute to the formation of ozone and particulate matter and is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular health problems.<br/><br/><br/>
