      <h1>Article: Water</h1>
      <p>
       As indicated by various Organization, water pollution executes around 1.2 Million deaths in India Every Year. None of the Indian cities compiles with water quality standard provided by World Health Organization. Water Pollution is the single greatest natural wellbeing hazard. Keeping in mind the end goal to balance this rising issue and make a move to tidy up Indian water (and Indeed water far and wide), it's important to first distinguish where is the most contamination concentrated, how it happens, what components are included and how we can kill them. So as to do this, far reaching water checking must be attempted on a national and global scale. This issue needs to be concerned about and what help we can get from the technology we have around us is going to be high pointed. This will also be rendered that how IoT will have its significance for making and recreating the innovative water quality Index. A Water Quality Index (WQI) denotes to the statistics to the public where in water quality data can be seen in consistent manner which being supplied to them. This index is as similar as the AQI (Air Quality Index) and UVI (Ultra Violet Index) which states the quality from its supply to the public. Several methods can be applied to assess the quality of the water but in order to avoid the quality complexity due to the parameter consideration, WQI is rather a superlative method to be opted for the said assessment. As far as IoT is concerned, Internet of things (IoT) is the between frameworks organization of physical contraptions, vehicles (in like manner insinuated as “related devices” and “clever devices”), structures, and distinctive things—embedded with equipment, programming, sensors, actuators, and framework arrange that engage these articles to accumulate and exchange data. IoT has been called “the structure of the information society” by the Global Standards Initiative on Internet of Things (IoT-GSI) in 2013. With many powerful IoT devices, one such being the Raspberry Pi, we can develop applications that will help in the above explained issue which also aid our lives to get easy and can save our time and energy by automating things with the help of Internet.

      <h1>Article: Air</h1>
      Air pollution is one of the biggest public health issues we face globally, and it’s getting worse.

Most of the world’s population live in places that exceed the World Health Organization’s air quality guideline limits. 
Invisible particles penetrate cells and organs in our bodies – our lungs, heart, blood and brain. This leads to millions suffering with diseases like asthma, strokes, heart attacks, cancer and dementia.
Babies, children, older people and those with existing health conditions are most severely affected by polluted air. 90% of deaths caused by air pollution are in low- and middle-income countries.Funding for air quality initiatives does not match the severity of the problem. As outlined in The State of Global Air Quality Funding, less than 1% of official development funding, and less than 0.1% of philanthropic foundation funding, is spent on air quality projects. Given the huge human impact of air pollution, there is an urgent need and opportunity for health funders to invest in air quality.The healthcare community has a history of effective action on major public health issues. Many healthcare providers see first hand the harmful effects of air pollution on patients. 
Health care providers can give information to patients about risks and reducing exposure. For example, 2,000 public health centres in Chattisgarh state in India put up posters on air pollution and health. Healthcare workers in St Ormond Street hospital in London ran a clean air campaign to reduce dirty air in the streets around their hospital. 
Health professionals can also facilitate the sharing of health data to governments, which can inform clean air policy.
